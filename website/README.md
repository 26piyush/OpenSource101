# Welcome to Hacktober!
If you're looking at this section, chances are that you wanted to know how the website functions.

This is a React application, which was made to dynamically parse through the JSON file which contains information provided by the users who send in PRs!
Upon parsing the JSON file, we create cards for each individual user and display it in the webpage.

We recommend that you go through the workflow that builds all the PR merged JSON files into a single file, and then the application which utilizes it to create cards.
Happy Hacking!
